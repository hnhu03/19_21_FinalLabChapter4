i
usually
don
t
write
negative
reviews
but
i
guess
there
is
anh
first
for
everything
i
came
here
yesterday
around
lunch
time
with
other
guest
before
entering
the
store
i
saw
anh
few
people
in
the
buffet
i
looked
at
the
sashimi
and
sushi
from
outside
and
they
looked
very
declicuis
i
went
in
sat
down
and
order
the
buffet
meal
drinks
water
melon
juice
very
nice
gava_juice
oi
very
nicefoods
all
the
meats
here
had
no
flavour
i
had
to
order
chopped
garlic
on
the
side
i
could
dip
the
meat
in
it
there
was
some
flavour
i
also
remember
ordering
salt
and
pepper
i
could
dip
the
meats
in
it
as
well
before
cooking
for
the
price
i
paid
i
expect
there
to
be
flavour
in
the
meat
their_sashimi_plate
outside
was
never
refilled
i
remembering
try
to
back
for
some
sashimi
salmon
but
it
was
always
gone
even
the
hot_pot
had
no
flavour
honestly
for
the
price
i
had
for
the
total
meal
which
was
around
million
dong
it
was
not
worth
it
staff
they
were
friendly
and
fast
with
my
orders
i
can
not
find
anh
problem
with
them
ambiance
outside
and
interior
was
renovated
very
nicely
i
can
see
the
owner
most
of
put
alot
of
money
into
the
place
to
dress
it
up
the
shop
was
clean
tables
